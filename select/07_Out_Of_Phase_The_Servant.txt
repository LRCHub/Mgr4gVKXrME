I wish that you were here
Coz the night is so clear
Like beautiful lake
Like a star jangled cape

Ministers in drag
Like wind scattered rags
Float spectral with hate
Through housing estates

Can you help this boy to find a home?
He's really lost is way
Can you help this girl not feel alone?
She's really lost her way
These days are out of phase
These days are out of phase
Can you help this boy to find a home?
He's really lost is way
Can you help this girl not feel alone?
She's really lost her way
These days are out of phase
These days are out of phase
